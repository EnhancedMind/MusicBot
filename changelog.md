Updated ytdl-core to version 4.11.4

Modified the skip command to not skip if it has arguments that aren't for skipping to specific position  
Added poweroff alias to shutdown command  
Nowplaying debug mode now only works for bot owner  
The shutdown command now also destroys all the connections, ends all nowplaying updaters and says it's shutting down in playing guilds before it destroys the client  
Fixed the skipto command so it skips to the correct position
